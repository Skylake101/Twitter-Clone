Project can be downloaded and run in visual studio code; however project is _not_ currently live on Google Firebase

Twitter Clone Developed with JavaScript React, CSS and HTML.

All code is written and implimented by me.
Project was inspired and guided by a 4.5 hour video tutorial from the 'Clever Programmer' on how to make a twitter clone. The video demonstration can be found on Youtube.


I'm in the process of trying to get it functional with Google Firebase, and add a more extensive feed experience.
